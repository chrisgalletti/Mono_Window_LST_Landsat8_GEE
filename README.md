# Mono_Window_LST_Landsat8_GEE
This repository is to store Google Earth Engine code to estimate Land Surface Temperature (LST) using Landsat 8. The code is based on a paper by Wang et al. 2015:

*"An Improved Mono-Window Algorithm for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor Data" Remote Sens. 2015, 7, 4268-4289; doi:10.3390/rs70404268

the code is not completely automated. Certain information will need to be obtained before running the code. See the comments in the code.
